# DecodeEncode
### What it does
It just allows you to input a string, which then returns a different "randomised" string, you can then decode that "randomised" string back into the original string.

Its not actually random, I just chose random letters and remapped the alphabet with them. I also added a function that randomly adds special characters (obfuscation) to the encoded message, and a function to remove said special characters in the decoder.

Using this with randoms will make it near impossible for them to understand what your saying unless they know the charmapping, send it to your friends and you can both talk in code!

### Why?
I basically made this just to learn how to manipulate string, and how to do charmapping.
